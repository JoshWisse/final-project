# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

A poker game where you randomly get dealt 5 cards in a deck and it tells you what hand you have 

A board game that is kinda like a candy land type game except with cards 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan to work by myself

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Do I have to use somekind of outside source ? Or can I just make a really hard intense fucntion in visual studio code as my final project ?
