#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have made the deck of cards. I used a dictionary for this and was able to assign a value and a suit to each individual card. I was even able to use the random function to shuffle this dictionary like a deck of cards

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have to create functions that can accurately see what poker hand you have in your hand. These functions need to be able to determine what the best hand is. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have not really run into any problems yet as I have not really got into the meat and potatoes of the project yet. I have done more of the planning stages. I am going to really lock in on the project this week.
