# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

5-draw card poker

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I am going to shuffle a deck of cards in a dictionary. Draw 5 cards and it is going to tell you what hand you have and whether or not you won against the other player.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This software will have everything we were taught in class maybe outside of reading a file. I will use dictionaries to get the deck of cards. I am going to use random fucntions to randomly get 5 different cards. I will be making a lot of functions for every single possible card outcome you can have in poker. In these functions will be all the other tricks we have learned in this class. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I am working by myself 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish making the deck of cards and getting 5 cards randomly dealt to you and it telling you what hand you have.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think a better thing will be able to simulate the game 100 to maybe 1,000 times and have percenatges of what each outcome was in the game. Also keep track of how many wins every player has.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A best outcome would be everythimg I said plus getting like multiple players the ability to play in the game. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I am going to get refreshed on the features I need. The main one being dictionaries. The first step I need to do is make the deck of cards in a dictionary. I will need to do a little bit of research on the different types of poker hands and exactly which hands are better then the other hands. Overall I am really excited for this project.
